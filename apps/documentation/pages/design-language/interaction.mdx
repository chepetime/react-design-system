# Interaction

## Interaction States

<Callout emoji="🔄" type="info">
  **Purpose:** The Interaction States section explores the different interaction
  states that exist within the design system. It provides an overview of states
  such as normal, hover, focus, active, disabled, and more. This section
  explains the purpose of each state, how they communicate information to users,
  and how they can be combined with each other.

## State Tokens

<Callout emoji="🔑" type="info">
  **Purpose:** The State Tokens section focuses on the integration of state
  information into token names within the design system. It explains how state
  tokens can be used to define styles and behaviors specific to different
  interaction states. This section may provide examples of state tokens and
  their naming conventions.

## Aria-labels

<Callout emoji="♿" type="info">
  **Purpose:** The Aria-labels section highlights the relevance of Aria-labels
  in conveying information to assistive technologies for different interaction
  states. It emphasizes the importance of providing appropriate Aria-labels for
  accessible interactions and provides guidelines or examples for implementing
  them effectively.

## Input Methods/Interfaces

<Callout emoji="💡" type="info">
  **Purpose:** The Input Methods/Interfaces section identifies the different
  interfaces through which users can interact with the products. It covers
  touch, keyboard, mouse, voice, motion detection, and more. For each input
  method, this section explains user expectations and how interactions such as
  hover, pressing tab, and others should be handled.

## Gestures

<Callout emoji="🤙" type="info">
  **Purpose:** The Gestures section focuses on non-standard or alternative
  interactions supported by the design system. It defines the gestures that the
  system supports and provides guidance on when to use each gesture. It also
  discusses when to use gestures instead of more "standard" interactions and may
  include examples or guidelines for implementing gestures effectively.

## Motion

<Callout emoji="🎬" type="info">
  **Purpose:** The Motion section addresses the use of motion within the design
  system. It provides guidance on when and where to use motion, different types
  of animations used, and their intended communication purposes. This section
  may also cover easing and duration considerations, motion token logic and
  structure, and any accessibility concerns related to motion.
