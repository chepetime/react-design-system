## Accessibility

Buttons can have different states that are visually and programmatically conveyed to merchants.

- Use the ariaControls prop to add an aria-controls attribute to the button. Use the attribute to point to the unique id of the content that the button manages.
- If a button expands or collapses adjacent content, then use the ariaExpanded prop to add the aria-expanded attribute to the button. Set the value to convey the current expanded (true) or collapsed (false) state of the content.
- Use the disabled prop to set the disabled state of the button. This prevents merchants from being able to interact with the button, and conveys its inactive state to assistive technologies.
- Use the pressed prop to add an aria-pressed attribute to the button.

### Keyboard support

Buttons use browser defaults for keyboard interactions.

Give buttons keyboard focus with the tab key (or shift + tab when tabbing backwards)
Activate buttons with the enter/return key or the space key

#### Custom key events

Use the `onKeyDown`, `onKeyPress`, and `onKeyUp` props to create custom events for buttons. With these props, you can use buttons to create complex, custom interactions like drag-and-drop interfaces.

Since these props introduce non-standard features to buttons, make sure to include accessible instructions so that merchants can understand how to use these features.
