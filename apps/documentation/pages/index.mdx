## What is a Design System?

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guidelines, and documentation that help teams create consistent and cohesive user interfaces. It serves as a single source of truth for design and development standards, ensuring that products maintain visual and functional consistency across different platforms and devices.

Our design system embodies the best practices and principles that guide the creation of our digital products. It provides a foundation for building high-quality user experiences, promotes collaboration between designers and developers, and streamlines the design and development process.

## Purpose of the Design System Documentation

The Design System Documentation is a comprehensive resource that empowers our teams to effectively leverage the design system. It provides a centralized and up-to-date reference for understanding and implementing the design system components, guidelines, and best practices.

By using the Design System Documentation, you will:

- Gain a deep understanding of our design system's principles, components, and usage guidelines.
- Ensure consistent and efficient design and development across projects.
- Facilitate collaboration and communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- Streamline the design and development process, reducing duplication of efforts.
