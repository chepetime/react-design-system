# Rationale of Each Theme

<Callout emoji="🎨" type="info">
  **Purpose:** The Rationale of Each Theme section provides an explanation for
  the different themes available in the design system. It explores the reasons
  behind the inclusion of specific themes, such as dark mode and high-contrast,
  and discusses their benefits for users. Additionally, it covers the impact of
  themes on color/style schemes, token usage, and their implementation in both
  design files and code.
</Callout>

## Dark Mode

<Callout emoji="🌑" type="info">
  **Purpose:** The Dark Mode topic explains the benefits of using a dark color
  scheme in the design system. It highlights how dark mode can help reduce eye
  strain and enhance visual comfort, particularly in low-light environments. It
  also discusses considerations and guidelines for implementing dark mode in
  design files and code.
