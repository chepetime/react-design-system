# H1 Header

## H2 Header

### H3 Header

#### H4 Header

##### H5 Header

###### H6 Header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.
2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and monospace. Itemized lists look like:

- this one
- that one
- the other one 2

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text content starts at 4-columns in.

```js
console.log("Hello world");
```

## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1.  first item
2.  second item
3.  third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and monospace. lists
look like:

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺

```
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
```

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
```

### An h3 header

Now a nested list:

1.  First, get these ingredients:

    - carrots
    - celery
    - lentils

2.  Boil some water.

3.  Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

```js
console.log("Hello world");
```

Tables can look like this:

size material color

---

9 leather brown
10 hemp canvas natural
11 glass transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:

---

keyword text

---

red Sunsets, apples, and
other red or reddish
things.

green Leaves, grass, frogs
and other things it's
not easy being.

---

A horizontal rule follows.
